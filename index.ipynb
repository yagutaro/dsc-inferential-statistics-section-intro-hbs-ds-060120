    "In this section, we're returning to statistics to broaden and deepen our understanding of distributions and sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by providing an introduction to the idea of **_Sampling_** - selecting a subset of a population to survey.  We'll then start to introduce some statistics related to sampling by explaining and showing how to calculate the standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we understand a bit about sampling, we'll explore how we can use it by digging deep into one of the coolest and most important concepts in inferential statistics--the **_Central Limit Theorem_**! We'll start by learning about how the Central Limit Theorem works, and explore how we can use it in a way that allows us to treat non-normal distributions as normal distributions, and provides a way for us to estimate parameters about a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The T-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll end this section by learning about how we can use the **_T-Distribution_** for dealing with samples that are smaller, and that have an unknown standard deviation. We'll explore how the T-Distribution works, learn about *degrees of freedom*, and then see how we can calculate confidence intervals using our newfound knowledge of the T-Distribution. "

    "While some of this material may seem a little dry, a deep understanding of and intuition for distributions and sampling will be important in your career as a data scientist. This knowledge will help you avoid making mistakes in your EDA (exploratory data analysis), feature selection, and modeling work, which could lead to faulty predictions from your models."
